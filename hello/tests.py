# Create your tests here.


# Note: The tests below rely upon static assets (for the rendered templates), so require that either:
# 1. The static assets have been processed - ie: `./manage.py collectstatic` has been run.
# 2. Or, the tests are run in debug mode (which means WhiteNoise will use auto-refresh mode),
#    using: `./manage.py test --debug-mode`
